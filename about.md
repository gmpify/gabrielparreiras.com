Brazilian and living in the UK since November 2017, I moved to Manchester to work as a DevOps Engineer with Cake Solutions Ltd - a BAMTECH Media Company.

On the last 3 years, I've worked with media companies focusing on streaming videos on the internet. Been in projects since the encoding up until the distribution of content, mostly handling infrastructure decisions, architecting systems, enhancing and performing deployments and supporting production environments.

My hobbies are to play board games and video games, cycle and travel. I like to find my way around new places and meet interesting people.
